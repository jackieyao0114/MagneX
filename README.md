# MagneX
MagneX is a massively parallel, 3D micromagnetics solver for modeling magnetic materials.
MagneX solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations, including exchange, anisotropy, demagnetization, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling.
The algorithm is implemented using Exascale Computing Project software framework, AMReX, which provides effective scalability on manycore and GPU-based supercomputing architectures.
# Documentation and Getting Help
More extensive documentation is available [HERE](https://amrex-microelectronics.github.io).
Our community is here to help. Please report installation problems or general questions about the code in the github [Issues](https://github.com/AMReX-Microelectronics/MagneX/issues) tab above.
# Installation
Here are instructions for a basic, pure-MPI (no GPU) installation.  More detailed instructions for GPU systems are in the full documentation.
## Download AMReX and MagneX Repositories
Make sure that AMReX and MagneX are cloned at the same root location. \
``` >> git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.git ``` \
``` >> git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Microelectronics/MagneX.git ```
## Dependencies
Beyond a standard Ubuntu22 installation, the Ubuntu packages libfftw3-dev, libfftw3-mpi-dev, and cmake are required.\
SUNDIALS is optional and enables Runge-Kutta, implicit, and multirate integrators (more detailed instructions in the full documentation).\
heFFTe is a required dependency.  At the same level that AMReX and MagneX are cloned, run: \
``` >> git clone https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/heffte.git ```\
``` >> cd heffte ```\
``` >> mkdir build ```\
``` >> cd build ```\
``` >> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. -DHeffte_ENABLE_FFTW=ON -DHeffte_ENABLE_CUDA=OFF .. ```\
``` >> make -j4 ```\
``` >> make install```
## Build
 Navigate to MagneX/Exec/ and run:\
```>> make -j4```

# Running MagneX
You can run the following to simulate muMAG Standard Problem 4 dynamics:\
```>> ./main3d.gnu.MPI.ex standard_problem_inputs/inputs_std4```
# Visualization and Data Analysis
Refer to the following link for several visualization tools that can be used for AMReX plotfiles.

### Data Analysis in Python using yt 
You can extract the data in numpy array format using yt (you can refer to this for installation and usage of [yt](https://yt-project.org/). After you have installed yt, you can do something as follows, for example, to get variable 'Mx' (x-component of magnetization)
```
import yt
ds = yt.load('./plt00010000/') # for data at time step 10000
ad0 = ds.covering_grid(level=0, left_edge=ds.domain_left_edge, dims=ds.domain_dimensions)
Mx_array = ad0['Mx'].to_ndarray()
```
